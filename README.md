# Hi there âœŒ
I'm Leonardo, a student at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://tue.nl), currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

Ever since I was little, I have been interested in computers. I am obsessed with learning all there is to know about computers. The past few years, I learned about the foundations of computers, networking, computer security, cryptology, visualizations, machine learning and I acquired a good command of programming, design principles and software patterns in a variety of different programming languages. In more recent years, I have also developed an interest for web technologies and UI/UX, which resulted in becoming a freelancer under the name [Digitam](https://digitam.nl). Here, I design logo's, mockups and brand designsystems, and create websites using React on the frontend with GatsbyJS or NextJS and various languages on the backend.

Additionally, I am working as a junior software developer at Artemtech, were we create enterprise and business related web applications using awesome technologies such as NextJS, Typescript, Hasura, and docker.

I am very interesed in taking on new opportunities. You can contact me at contact(at)leonardomathon.nl.
